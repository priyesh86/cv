## Experience

### Web Application Developer, [TravelLocal](https://www.travellocal.com/)

_October 2018 - present_

A platform connecting travellers with travel agents, who are based in the destination countries. These agents then use their local expertise to build bespoke itineraries for the traveller.

The technology used includes TypeScript, React, Redux, Next.js, node.js, Jest, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker and Terraform.

#### Responsibilities

- Full-stack developer, working across all aspects of the platform

- Database design and migration

- API design

- Third party integration with HubSpot CRM platform, which has included triggering emails via their API, syncing customer data with their platform and back-populating historic data

- Handling frontline support, triaging urgent bugs and queries, which includes the use of system monitoring tools such as Datadog

- Contributing to setting team goals (OKRs), sprint planning, retrospectives, reviews and backlog refinement as part of an engaged, agile scrum team

#### Work I'm most proud of

- Ran HTML and CSS workshops for non-engineers - mainly for marketing to be able to build emails in HubSpot. These sessions empowered colleagues to take on these tasks themselves and learn new skills. I found teaching to be a fun and rewarding experience.

- As part of the Sustainability and Ethics internal task force, I am currently looking into the topic of carbon accounting and how best to measure the company's carbon emissions

- Taking joint responsibility for the full lifecycle of delivering a major new feature: a text snippet tool that allows travel agents to create, manage and use text snippets in their messages to customers. We gathered requirements from stakeholders, used paper prototypes to test and iterate on designs and built the MVP under a feature flag. After positive feedback from a subset of agents, we released the feature and the metrics put in place to track its outcome show usage has been high and considerable agent time has been saved.

- Used my personal development time to found a data analytics guild, which brought together people from different parts of the business who were interested in data science. I ran the group, chaired the meetings and took minutes. During that time I was able to learn R, create reports of my analyses using Jupyter Notebooks and build the first iteration of a booking likelihood model, which predicted how likely a traveller was to book a trip based on their enquiry form submission.

### Frontend Developer, [LendInvest](https://www.lendinvest.com/)

_April 2017 - July 2018_

A Fintech platform that provides loans for commercial and residential property development.

The technology used included React, jQuery, Jest and PHP.

#### Responsibilities

- Sole developer for the marketing site, built on WordPress. Responsible for the development of both in-house and third party themes and plugins, site installations, deployment, CMS administration and third party integration (Salesforce, Stripe, Segment, Zapier, etc.).

- I worked autonomously and with minimal supervision. The site went through a number of major overhauls during my time there (including the main navigation and careers section), which required a close-knit collaboration with Product and UX.

#### Work I'm most proud of

- Improved site performance by reducing initial load time from around 5.5 to 1.4 seconds (75%). This was achieved by first identifying sources of performance sinks within the code using PHP profiling and then implementing a combination of solutions, which included reducing total JS/CSS asset weight and count, refactoring expensive code that had been discovered through profiling and configuring and optimising CDN caching.

### Freelance frontend developer, [AniForteUK](https://www.aniforte.co.uk/)

_March 2017 - April 2017_

A pet supplies store.

I designed and built the company's [blog](https://www.aniforte.co.uk/blogs/news) on the Shopify platform. This was using a combination of JavaScript and Liquid (Shopify's templating language). I wireframed the pages in Sketch.

## Projects

### Plucky

Mental health app that allows users to journal their worries.

Built with React Native, TypeScript, Express, Jest, MongoDB and Firebase for authentication.

Created in collaboration with a few friends, I worked on the project as a developer, UX designer and product owner, writing the majority of user stories and leading the team.

Available on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pluckyapp&hl=en_US&gl=US). (I am using the free Heroku server, so if you try to make an account and nothing happens please wait 30 seconds because that's how long it takes the server to boot - apologies!)
